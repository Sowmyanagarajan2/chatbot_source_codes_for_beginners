# 🤖 Chatbot for Beginners – Notes & Flow

---

## ✅ What is a Chatbot?

A **chatbot** is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users. It can be used in websites, apps, voice assistants, and customer support.

---

## 🧠 Types of Chatbots

1. **Rule-Based Chatbots**

   * Follow fixed rules or `if-else` logic.
   * Example: “If user says ‘hi’, reply with ‘hello’”.
   * Simple to build but limited in conversation.

2. **AI/ML-Based Chatbots**

   * Use machine learning or NLP (Natural Language Processing).
   * Can understand context, intent, and provide smart responses.
   * Example: Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT.

## ⚙️ Components of a Chatbot

| Component                                | Description                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Input**                           | The message typed by the user.                      |
| **NLU (Natural Language Understanding)** | Understands what the user means (intent, entities). |
| **Dialog Manager**                       | Decides how the bot should respond.                 |
| **NLG (Natural Language Generation)**    | Converts the bot’s reply into human-readable text.  |
| **Response Output**                      | Final message shown to the user.                    |

## 🛠 Chatbot Development Flow

### Step 1: Define Purpose

* What should the chatbot do? (e.g., FAQ bot, sales bot, learning bot)

### Step 2: Choose the Type

* Rule-based or AI-based?

### Step 3: Collect Data

* Common questions and answers
* User intents (book ticket, get weather, etc.)

### Step 4: Build the Bot

#### ➤ Rule-Based (Simple)

```python
if "hi" in user_input:
    print("Bot: Hello!")
```

#### ➤ AI-Based (Advanced)

* Use libraries like:

  * `ChatterBot` (simple)
  * `Transformers` (for GPT-based chat)
  * `Rasa` (open-source NLP framework)

### Step 5: Train the Bot

* Feed questions and answers
* Or use pre-trained models

### Step 6: Deploy

* Integrate into a website, app, or chatbot platform

---

## 🧪 Example: Simple Rule-Based Bot

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("You: ").lower()
    if user_input == "bye":
        print("Bot: Bye!")
        break
    elif "hi" in user_input:
        print("Bot: Hello!")
    else:
        print("Bot: I didn't understand that.")
```

---

## 🌍 Real-Life Use Cases

* Customer support (Swiggy, Amazon chat)
* Booking systems (IRCTC bots)
* Education (AI tutors)
* HR & recruitment (interview bots)
* Entertainment (ChatGPT)

---

## 🧠 Terms to Know

| Term                 | Meaning                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Intent**           | What the user wants (e.g., "book a cab")   |
| **Entity**           | Specific info (e.g., location = "Chennai") |
| **Corpus**           | Dataset of conversations for training      |
| **Confidence Score** | How sure the bot is about the response     |

## ✅ Tools You Can Use (No PyTorch Needed)

| Tool/Library | Type        | Language | Notes                     |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| ChatterBot   | Rule + ML   | Python   | Beginner-friendly         |
| Transformers | AI-based    | Python   | Use GPT-2 with TensorFlow |
| Dialogflow   | NLP Tool    | Web GUI  | Google’s chatbot platform |
| Rasa         | Open-source | Python   | Professional chatbot dev  |
| BotPress     | GUI + Code  | Node.js  | Visual flow builder       |

---

## 🎓 Tips for Beginners

* Start with **rule-based logic** first.
* Then try `ChatterBot` for learning how bots “learn”.
* Move to **transformer models** (like GPT-2) for natural conversations.
* Use **Gradio** or **Flask** to create a simple chatbot web UI.

## 💬 Objective

To create a **text-based chatbot** using your **own training data** (CSV or Excel) that can:

* Understand the user's question
* Find the most similar question from the dataset
* Respond with the matching answer

---

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Explanation

### 🔧 Step 0: Install Required Libraries (if not installed)

```python
# !pip install pandas sklearn nltk
```

You would run this if the required libraries (`pandas`, `sklearn`, `nltk`) are not already installed in your Python environment.

---

### 📥 Step 1: Load the CSV or Excel File

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('/content/chatbot_data.csv')  # You can also use pd.read_excel()
```

* `pandas` is used to read data from a CSV file.
* The file is expected to have **two columns**: `Question` and `Answer`.

---

### 📦 Step 2: Extract Questions and Answers

```python
questions = data['Question'].values
answers = data['Answer'].values
```

* We take the `Question` and `Answer` columns and store them in separate variables.
* `questions` is a list of questions asked previously.
* `answers` is a list of their corresponding answers.

---

### 🔡 Step 3: Convert Questions to Numbers (TF-IDF)

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
question_vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(questions)
```

* `TfidfVectorizer()` converts text into **numerical vectors** that represent **importance of words**.
* Each question becomes a vector of numbers — this is needed for comparison.

---

### 🤖 Step 4: Chatbot Logic – Match User Input

```python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def chatbot_response(user_input):
    user_vec = vectorizer.transform([user_input])  # Convert user question to vector
    similarity = cosine_similarity(user_vec, question_vectors)  # Compare with existing Qs
    index = similarity.argmax()  # Find most similar question
    confidence = similarity[0][index]  # Similarity score (0 to 1)
    
    if confidence > 0.3:  # Threshold to check if it's a good match
        return answers[index]
    else:
        return "Sorry, I don't understand your question."
```

#### ✨ What's Happening Here:

* Your input is compared with **all questions** in the dataset.
* The **most similar question** is found.
* If the match is **above 30%** (similarity > 0.3), the bot gives the corresponding answer.
* Otherwise, it says: "Sorry, I don't understand your question."

---

### 🗨️ Step 5: Chat Loop

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    if user_input.lower() in ['exit', 'quit', 'bye']:
        print("Bot: Goodbye!")
        break
    response = chatbot_response(user_input)
    print("Bot:",response)
```

* A loop to keep the chat going.
* It stops when you type **exit**, **quit**, or **bye**.
* Otherwise, it gets the response using the chatbot function and prints it.

## ✅ Example

### 📂 CSV File Content:

| Question           | Answer                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| What is your name? | I'm ChatBot.                  |
| How are you?       | I'm good, thank you!          |
| What can you do?   | I can answer basic questions. |

### 👨‍💻 User Chat:

```
You: What is your name?
Bot: I'm ChatBot.

You: What can you do?
Bot: I can answer basic questions.

You: What's the weather?
Bot: Sorry, I don't understand your question.
```
